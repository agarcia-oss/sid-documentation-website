This is introduced to specify that the only party an enterprise would be interested in and will consider in its systems is a party playing a role (directly or indirectly). &#13;&#10;[] Party Privacy ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;The Party Privacy Profile ABE contains all entities used by the Party Privacy Management process for specifying the information concerned by Privacy rules, the Privacy rules themselves, and the choices made by Parties for their own Privacy.&#13;&#10;[] Communication Interaction ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;The Communication Interaction ABE contains all entities needed for specifing a CommunicationInteraction describing an exchange of information during a communication between two or more human(s) and/or machine(s) during a period of time. &#13;&#10;        •&#9;CommunicationInteraction might concern Parties playing a role of Customer, Supplier… or even Resource, therefore the ABE « CommunicationInteraction ABE » is located in « Common Business Entities Domain ».&#13;&#10;[] Calendar ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;Represents Entities used to provide time related functions. This includes scheduling, time conflicts and time based presentation support.&#13;&#10;[] Location ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;The Location ABE represents the site or position of something, such as a customer’s address, the site of equipment where there is a fault and where is the nearest person who could repair the equipment, and so forth.  Locations can take the form of coordinates and/or addresses and/or physical representations.&#13;&#10;[] Project ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;Represents the tools used by project managers to ensure that enterprise objectives of quality, cost and time are achieved by planning and scheduling work.

It also includes thresholds used to evaluate the metric and the consequences of violating the thresholds.&#13;&#10;[] Performance ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;Represents a measure of the manner in which a Product and/or Service and/or Resource is functioning.&#13;&#10;[] Policy ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;The Policy Domain consists of a set of layered ABEs that define specifications (e.g., templates) and definitions of Policy entities that can be used in managing the behavior and definition of entities in other Domains.&#13;&#10;[] Test ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;A test is a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of an entity, especially before it is taken into widespread use. A test may also be executed upon the entity after it is in use to diagnose problems related to the correct functioning of the entity. As such, a test may be executed against a product, a service, or a resource.&#13;&#10;[] Usage ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;An occurrence of employing a Product, Service or Resource for its intended purpose, which is of interest to the business and can have charges applied to it.

This ABE is not fully developed.&#13;&#10;[] Trouble Ticket ABE&#13;&#10;        •&#9;Represents a record used for reporting and managing the resolution of Trouble or Problem.
