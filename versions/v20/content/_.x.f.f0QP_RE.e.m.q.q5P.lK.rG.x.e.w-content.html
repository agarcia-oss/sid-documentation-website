</span><span class="ElementTitle">Diagram [ComD-01] Common ABEs Level 1<br>
</span><span class="ElementDocumentation">The diagram below lists the Common Domain's ABEs.</br></br>[] Party ABE</br>        •	A Party represents an individual, an organization, or an organization unit that are of interest, involved or that provide value directly or indirectly from an enterprise perspective (Enterprise is to be understood here as provider, service provider or operator). </br>        •	Hence the Party plays one or more roles with the enterprise or with another Party playing a role with the enterprise (indirectly). This is introduced to specify that the only party an enterprise would be interested in and will consider in its systems is a party playing a role (directly or indirectly). </br>[] Party Privacy ABE</br>        •	The Party Privacy Profile ABE contains all entities used by the Party Privacy Management process for specifying the information concerned by Privacy rules, the Privacy rules themselves, and the choices made by Parties for their own Privacy.</br>[] Communication Interaction ABE</br>        •	The Communication Interaction ABE contains all entities needed for specifing a CommunicationInteraction describing an exchange of information during a communication between two or more human(s) and/or machine(s) during a period of time. </br>        •	CommunicationInteraction might concern Parties playing a role of Customer, Supplier… or even Resource, therefore the ABE « CommunicationInteraction ABE » is located in « Common Business Entities Domain ».</br>[] Calendar ABE</br>        •	Represents Entities used to provide time related functions. This includes scheduling, time conflicts and time based presentation support.</br>[] Location ABE</br>        •	The Location ABE represents the site or position of something, such as a customer’s address, the site of equipment where there is a fault and where is the nearest person who could repair the equipment, and so forth.  Locations can take the form of coordinates and/or addresses and/or physical representations.</br>[] Project ABE</br>        •	Represents the tools used by project managers to ensure that enterprise objectives of quality, cost and time are achieved by planning and scheduling work. It uses common industry definition of Project, Work Breakdown Structure and Activity to provide support to project managers. </br>[] Users and Roles ABE</br>        •	Represents types of users and roles and their involvment in the usage of products, services and resources.</br>[] Product Order ABE</br>        •	The Product Order ABE contains all entities required to specify a communication used to procure or update one or many Products in the context of a ProductOffering.</br>This pattern is used to define CustomerProductOrder corresponding to Products ordered by a Customer to the Service Provider and BusinessPartnerProductOrder corresponding to Products ordered by the Service Provider to a Business Partner</br>[] Base Types ABE</br>        •	A small simple object, like money or a date range, whose equality isn't based on identity.</br>[] Root Business Entities ABE</br>        •	A set of common business entities that collectively serve as the foundation of the business view. This set of entities enables the entities in different domains of the SID Framework to be associated with each other, providing greater overall coherence to the information framework.</br>[] Account ABE</br>        •	The Account ABE contains all entities needed for specifing basic attributes and relationships that describe an account.</br>[] Business Interaction ABE</br>        •	The Business Interaction ABE represents an arrangement, contract, or communication between an enterprise and one or more other entities such as individuals and organizations (or parts of organizations).  Interactions take on the form of requests, responses, and notifications.</br>[] Agreement ABE</br>        •	An Agreement represents a contract or arrangement, either written or verbal and sometimes enforceable by law, such as a service level agreement or a customer price agreement. An agreement involves a number of other business entities, such as products, services, and resources and/or their specifications.</br>[] Capacity ABE</br>        •	A generalized ABE and specializations that provide capacity and capacity demand for products, services, and resources. Capacity is the ability to provide some capability.  For example, one measure of network capacity is the ability of a network to provide a certain amount of bandwidth during the month of May.</br>[] Catalog ABE</br>        •	A generalized ABE that represents common Catalog Specification and Catalog entities, attributes, and associations shared (inherited) by components of the Entity, Federated, Product, Service, and Resource Catalog ABEs.</br>[] Configuration and Profiling ABE</br>        •	A Configuration (also referred to as a Profile) defines how a Resource, Service, or Product operates or functions in terms of Characteristic Specifications and related Product/Service/Resource Specifications as well as Characteristics and related Product/Service/Resource entities.</br>[] Metric ABE</br>        •	The Metric ABE defines standards of measurement including units and values and how the values are determined. It also includes thresholds used to evaluate the metric and the consequences of violating the thresholds.</br>[] Performance ABE</br>        •	Represents a measure of the manner in which a Product and/or Service and/or Resource is functioning.</br>[] Policy ABE</br>        •	The Policy Domain consists of a set of layered ABEs that define specifications (e.g., templates) and definitions of Policy entities that can be used in managing the behavior and definition of entities in other Domains.</br>[] Test ABE</br>        •	A test is a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of an entity, especially before it is taken into widespread use. A test may also be executed upon the entity after it is in use to diagnose problems related to the correct functioning of the entity. As such, a test may be executed against a product, a service, or a resource.</br>[] Usage ABE</br>        •	An occurrence of employing a Product, Service or Resource for its intended purpose, which is of interest to the business and can have charges applied to it. It is comprised of characteristics, which represent attributes of usage.</br>[] Topology ABE</br>        •	The Topology ABE contains entities that are used to represent topological concepts that can be used to model a large variety of topological relations between entities ranging from dependencies to connectivity.</br>[] Event ABE</br>        •	The Event ABE contains entities that are used to represent events, their occurrence and their recording within systems. This ABE is not fully developed.</br>[] Trouble Ticket ABE</br>        •	Represents a record used for reporting and managing the resolution of Trouble or Problem. This ABE is not fully developed.</br>[] Trouble or Problem ABE</br>        •	A description of a problem that can be shared between the service provider and the customer. Trouble or Problem is an indication that an entity (such as Resource, Service or Product) is no longer functioning according to the expected SLA.<br>
